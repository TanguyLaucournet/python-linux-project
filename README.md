# python-linux-project
This is a project to learn how to use Socket | Shared memory | Semaphore using Python and do a Makefile to easily interact with them
I had some troubles with the makefile.
For the Shared memory exercise, I need to run the server then the client and interact with the server and wasn't able to do it automatically from the makefile.
Also, I haven't been able to get missing modules and install them automatically with make check and make install
I think I should use virtualenv in order to do this but i never used this and had many troubles trying to use it.
